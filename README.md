# Welcome to Counters! 🔖📌

Counters is a beautiful app that allows you to have the counts of whatever you want and have them sync on the cloud. 🤓

## Features

Explore and have the counters control right on the counter list, where you can see all counts you have created.
All counters are sync on the cloud. Pull to refresh to see more. ☁️ 📲

Create a new counter. Just set a new title for your count and a new one will be created with the counter ready to be incremented ⬆️


### Have the record

You can increment or decrement your counter's count with just a tap right in your list view ✅

#### Need for a hint?

Use the search bar to look for an specific counter 🔍

Once you find it, you can handle it from that search (soon...)


### Delete them (coming soon...)

You can delete one or many as you want from the list view ⛔️

(Due the deadline and for not taking more time of the deadline to accomplish the app and for personal vacations during holidays, this last feature is pending among with the management of the counter from the search results list...)

### More notes

Due my development times I saw some practices I could have included, but I would definetely include on conditions with more time and are the following:

- More unit tests (My current development includes testable elements using protocols, dependency injection by initializers and properties, add them wouldn't require more effort on refactoring)

- Constants structs/enums to have more control on identifiers, strings, static numbers like constants constraints

- Accessibility identifiers for voice over. I could have added this kind of features but I would have required more time to test with the accessibility inspector the reight functionality but it's also a must.
